# Twilight Of Humanity #

> "According to the genetic bottleneck theory, between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago, human populations sharply decreased to 3,000–10,000 surviving individuals. It is supported by genetic evidence suggesting that today's humans are descended from a very small population of between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs that existed about 70,000 years ago."

*Will you survive the twilight of Humanity?*

Today we tend to forget to fear the dark, to forget how cruel nature can be and to forgot how fragile we human beings are. It's worth remembering how near we came to extinction at one stage.

Twilight of Humanity was created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 31 ("Entire Game On One Screen") Compo. It is all my own work except the Norse font created by Joel Carrouche, which the rules allows.

## Disclaimer ##

In this game you can, and will, starve, be eaten and die of hypothermia. It is not a friendly game. You are supposed to be confused, you are supposed to struggle to figure out the game's system, and you are supposed to ultimately fail to survive. In this it is akin to a minimalistic Dwarf Fortress.

## Launch instructions ##

Due to the way LÖVE 2D​ games are built for Windows Mac and Linux users can launch the executable using LÖVE 0.9 as though it were a .love file.

Or you can just use WINE.
